## Libraries

### Firebase

We have used Firestore for the database, with api calls to obtain the products. The deploy can actually also be done here! Make sure to explore [firebase] (https://firebase.google.com/)

### Material UI

Material UI for the styling of elements, making available the reusability of them while building on the already developed Material UI options. All about [Material] (https://mui.com/)

### React-router-dom

This library is used to handle the navigation between different components, even allowing different renders based on the url passed using the useParams hook. [Here] (https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) more!
